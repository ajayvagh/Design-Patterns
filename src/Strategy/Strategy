Strategy :

=> when u have more than 1 way to do something Use Strategy

Google Maps
Multiple route methods like bike, car, walk, train

- <<Route Strategy >>
- Build Route() method
- public getRouteStrategy(Mode mode) if walk = mode.walk ...
- multiple classes of the interface
- walk Strategy
- car Strategy
- bike Strategy

Route Strategy rs = mode.getRouteStrategy();
rs.buildRoute()

it will depend on mode
which ever mode is in mode.getRouteStrategy();

- if else blocks but not violating OCP or SRP
- bcz business logic

either we can use If else or HashMap Map ( Mode, RouteStrategy )
difference
- hashmap returns object again and again after created
- in if else object created when required
- but in hashmap it will create

=> whenever there are multiple ways to do something we should think of Strategy DP
