Registry :

contains / stores information

Holds Objects for you, that might we want to ReUse later

any object that you don't want to use right away, but you require in future you save it using registry

Registry is used with protoType to store Prototypes

2 methods

void register(String key, Student s)
store the given object in registry

Student get(String key)
return the object with the given key

uses map internally

Multiple objects of Registry should not exist so make it singleton

public class StudentRegistry {

    private static StudentRegistry instance;

    private StudentRegistry() {
        map = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public static StudentRegistry getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new StudentRegistry();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    private Map< String, Student > map;

    public void register(String key, Student s) {
        map.put(key, s);
    }
    public Student get(String key) {
        return map.get(key);
    }
}
